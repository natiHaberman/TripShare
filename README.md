Created with the goal of improving my web-development capabilities, this project is a live full stack web-application built using the MERN stack. JoyRide is a ridesharing web application aimed at enabling people to connect in order to carpool. 
These are the following areas in which I would like to improve the project:

-Fix the buggy MapInput component which causes rerendering when hitting enter.

-The Application only facilitates rides between one driver and one passenger. This was done for simplicity in implementing requests but should be modified to include multiple passengers.

-Incorporate live location in the map components.

-The project has scalability issues such as sorting rides and request data on the client side as opposed to on the server.

-Improve security.

-Modify the application to address date of ride departure instead of only time
