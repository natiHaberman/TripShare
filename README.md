This project has been created with the goal of improving my web-devpolpment capabilies through building a live fill stack web-application.
JoyRide is a ridesharing web application aimed at enabling people to conncect in order to carpool.

These are the following areas in which I would like to improve the project:

-Fix the buggy MapInput component which causes rerendering when hitting enter.

-The Application only facilitates rides between one driver and one passenger. This was done for simplicity in implementing requests but should be modified to include multiple passengers.

-Incorporate live location in the map components.

-The project has scalability issues such as sorting rides and request data on the client side as opposed to on the server.

-Improve security.

-Modify the application to adress date of ride departure instead of only time.
